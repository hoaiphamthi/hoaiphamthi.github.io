== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the [https://www.kth.se/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078 Division of Decision and Control Systems], [https://www.kth.se/en/eecs/skolan-for-elektroteknik-och-datavetenskap-1.760855 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] at KTH, working under the supervision of Prof. [https://people.kth.se/~mikaelj/ Mikael Johansson]. I received a BE degree from Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Viet Nam, in 2013; and an MS degree from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2016. Previously, I worked on wireless communications and networking.

I study theory and practice of optimization algorithms with an emphasis on large-scale problems that arise in machine learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in work at the intersections of continuous optimization with related fields such as numerical linear algebra, statistics, stochastic approximation, and control. Some of the topics I have been working on include:
- First-Order and Stochastic Optimization Methods 
- Structured Non-Smooth Non-Convex Optimization
- Parallel and Distributed Computations
- Applications of Optimization Methods in Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Control
- Computational Optimal Transport
