== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Decision and Control Systems, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KTH, working under the supervision of Prof. [https://people.kth.se/~mikaelj/ Mikael Johansson]. I received a BE degree from Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Viet Nam, in 2013; and an MS degree from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2016. Previously, I worked on wireless communications and networking.

My current research focuses on design and analysis of scalable optimization algorithms for computational challenges arising in machine learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in work at the intersections of continuous optimization with related fields such as numerical linear algebra, statistics, stochastic approximation, and control.

== Research
My research interests include 
- First-Order Optimization Methods 
- Structured Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization
- Parallel and Distributed Computations
- Applications of Optimization Methods in Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Control
