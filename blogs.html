<h1>The nice voice</h1>
</div>
<ul>

The days of online teaching make communication with students mainly through voice. I think it was an interesting situation. 
We seem to be concentrate on just one sense - hearing instead of looking arround students as in classes. 
I realize that many students have beautiful voices, and imagine he/she must have  beautiful soul matching that voice! <br />

How important the voice is! 
I remember that as I read the book "My Brief History" by Stephen Hawking, he said his thoughts when his muscular dystrophy made him
  increasingly difficult for speaking: "The voice of someone is very important. If you have a soft voice, others may see you as mentally unstable." 
  This statement, of course, concerning the physical properties of the voice and is obviously suitable for a person with normal health.<br />

However, the beautiful voice that I refer here not only mentioning about the sound quality of the voice but also 
  including the involved content - beautiful and honest words that make listeners feel very loved and comfortable.... <br />

So between a nice voice and an eye-catching appearance, which one do you like? <br />
